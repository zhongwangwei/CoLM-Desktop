# Preprocessor parity audit — 2026-09-14

**Full migration is not yet proven.** A successful Rust-to-Rust pipeline or a
single real case does not establish all-branch parity. The acceptance criteria
remain those in [mksrfdata](mksrfdata-rust-port.md) and
[mkinidata](mkinidata-rust-port.md), including field values, metadata, optional
branches, and an unchanged Fortran runtime consuming the Rust products.

## Evidence from this audit

- The supplied Pearl River namelist has no `DEF_USE_PC=.true.` and defaults to
  LCT. The case name contains `PC`, but the completed `--land-cover igbp` run
  therefore tested **LCT**, not PC. The old Rust topology had 957 elements
  and 7,698 patches; the independent original-source audit below supersedes it.
- The initial Rust surface was not directly readable by Fortran: four albedo
  files lacked `_patches` in their filenames and `soiltext_patches.nc` should
  have been `soiltexture_patches.nc` (variable remains `soiltext_patches`).
  Both Rust producer and static/time/PFT consumers now use the upstream names;
  the spatial fixture uses those names rather than duplicating the old error.
- `DEF_USE_SOILPAR_UPS_FIT` was ignored by the spatial executable. It now reaches
  both VGM and Campbell through LCT and PFT/PC adapters, defaulting to upstream
  `true`. A sparse two-cell fixture checks all eight layers with fitting on/off,
  plus the distinct soil file/variable names. Rayon equality covers both modes.
- `patch_coordinates` now preserves `areaquad`'s rounded degree conversion,
  km² area scale, and the upstream multiply-then-divide radian conversion.
  Algebraically cancelling these constants amplified tiny centroid changes in
  `extkb` near sunrise. A 2,048-pixel centroid check records values from the
  upstream Fortran functions, independent of the Rust implementation.

## Real spatial reference run

Local artifacts: `/tmp/colm-spatial-parity.Mh0VZX/` (path also recorded in
`/tmp/colm-spatial-parity-path`). Original successful Rust surface artifacts:
`/tmp/colm-pearl-rust-local-plant.k3k9sH/`.

The reference uses the vendored Fortran physics and `UNSTRUCTURED`, IGBP,
`FLAT_SPMD`, without `GridRiverLakeFlow`, matching the supplied ex07 header's
non-routing configuration. Only the generated compile-time header differs
from the standard build preset; Fortran physics sources are unchanged.
`build_no_routing.sh` and the build manifest record that configuration. The
standard spatial preset enables routing and cannot initialize this case
without additional unit-catchment routing inputs; that branch is **not covered**
by this comparison.

The previous soil/vegetation data were copied to the isolated reference tree;
the corrected Rust executable regenerated albedo, texture, and topology there.
Fortran and Rust `mkinidata` then both completed on this same landdata with
start date `1980-001-00000`. Their three restart files have matching filenames,
dimensions, variable names/types/order, and attributes except `create_time`.
The existing `golden-compare` confirms the 16 scalar constants are identical;
it deliberately still reports the floating-point value differences in the
other two files (it is a strict comparator, not a tolerance-based pass).

After the centroid correction, all differing fields except `extkb` are within
`abs(error) <= 1e-12 + 1e-12 * abs(reference)`. For `extkb`, one near-sunrise
patch has absolute error `6.3222e-10`, relative error `1.475e-12`:
`coszen` is approximately `0.00101131887337`, and its `1.49e-15` perturbation
is amplified by the inverse-cosine factor. This is recorded, not hidden by
relaxing the strict comparator or asserting bitwise parity.

## Original-source reference and runtime diagnosis

The user supplied `/Users/zhongwangwei/Desktop/Github/CoLM202X` as the original
source. Its current HEAD is `ebe6de998692f075216037810ce9184fa407e27b`; its only
working-tree change is `.gitignore`, which this audit did not touch. It is not
identical to Desktop's vendored, runtime-switch-enabled Fortran. In particular,
`DEF_TUNING_*` are Desktop extensions, not original namelist fields at that HEAD.

An isolated copy was built with UNSTRUCTURED + LULC_IGBP + vanGenuchten, serial,
without routing, urban, BGC, crop, tracer, or extended interception. Only the
host Makeoptions and generated compile header were changed, not source physics.
`original/source-commit.txt`, `original/sha256.txt`, and `build-original.sh` record
this build. The initial `make all` additionally failed linking an unrelated
postprocessor; explicitly building mksrfdata, mkinidata, and colm succeeded.

Both original-initialized and Rust-initialized Pearl River cases completed the
**unchanged original `colm.x`** run for 2003-01-01 00:00–01:00 (two 1800-second
steps) using the local JRA3Q forcing. See `original-initial/` and `original-rust/`
under the reference artifact root. This establishes runtime consumption for
this LCT case, not all-branch scientific equivalence.

The original and Rust cold restarts have the same 137 variables, dimensions,
and types; only the declaration order of `dz_lake`, `t_lake`, and `lake_icefrc`
differs in the time file. Scalar constants are identical. Initial numerical
differences remain at the levels recorded above. After two model steps the
maximum soil-temperature difference is `4.6333e-6 K`, liquid-water difference
`2.6634e-7 kg/m2`, and `gs0sun` difference `0.89036` (native units). These observed
differences are **not** asserted to pass a universal tolerance. Full comparison
is recorded in `original-restart-comparison.json`; scientific budgets remain a
completion gate.

The vendored runtime initially crashed with **both** Fortran and Rust restarts.
Original CoLMMAIN encloses the canopy-phase PFT allocation in the PFT/PC
compile-time guard. Desktop removed that guard without restoring its runtime
condition. The corrected allocation accesses `patch_pft_s/e` only for PFT/PC
soil patches and retains a one-slot unused argument for LCT's shared interface.
`oracle/scripts/test_lct_canopy_allocation.py` extracts and executes the actual
allocation block: it failed before the fix and passes 15 LCT/PFT/PC × patch-type
combinations afterward. The rebuilt production Desktop runtime also completed
both steps from Rust restart (`runtime-smoke/colm-fixed.status = 0`). A full
bounds-checked Desktop build instead crashed earlier in pixelset loading; this
separate debug-profile issue is not claimed resolved by the allocation fix.

## Independent surface generation and repaired aggregation

`original-surface/` completed unchanged original-Fortran mksrfdata successfully
(`surface.status = 0`, 22 min 16 s). It uses the same source mesh, land-cover year,
domain, rawdata overlay, and effective LCT mode, without reusing Rust landdata.

The original has 957 elements and **7,754 patches**, not the old Rust 7,698.
Rust had snapped slightly offset mesh boundaries to raw-data edges. It now
assimilates the exact mesh/raw/domain edge union, keeps the requested margins,
and excludes sub-1e-6-degree strips from membership as upstream does. The
`DEF_LANDONLY` default-true filter removes nonpositive landtype pixels and empty
elements before LCT/PFT partitioning; catchment keeps its distinct upstream rule.
Explicit `DEF_domain` bounds reach both LCT and PFT/PC executables. No-domain
source-extent behavior and the 25-million-pixel window limit remain limitations.

`rust-assimilated-land/` and `topology-comparison.json` establish, for this case:

- all **15,922,348** memberships match by element ID and patch class;
- 957 elements / 7,754 patches and six output blocks agree;
- pixel axes have 2,640 latitude / 6,240 longitude cells, with maximum coordinate
  differences 7.11e-15 / 2.85e-14 degrees;
- the newly written `patchfrac_elm_<block>.nc` fields differ by at most 1.706e-12.

The first independent field comparison then exposed missing
`USE_zip_for_aggregation` behavior: upstream sums covered pixel area per unique
source-grid cell before requesting values. Without this, repeated fine pixels
biased unweighted medians and nonlinear fitting: 116 first-layer Balland-Arp
alpha/beta pairs differed by up to 0.18 / 25. The new gathered flat mesh preserves
source x-then-y order and independent overlapping patch requests. All 116 pairs
now match **exactly**. True/false namelist and CLI controls are wired through the
shared 500 m LCT/PFT/PC fields, soil, USGS forest height, simple downscaling, and
patch/element wetness; remaining optional adapters need separate ZIP audits.

VGM mode must also run the Campbell fit for `psi_s` and `lambda`; upstream only
suppresses Campbell's `theta_s`/`k_s` writes. The previous area-mean substitute
was wrong and is replaced by the existing Campbell kernel. A disk regression
compares both modes with fitting on/off. Both fits now use Rayon per patch, with
ordered WMO copying and no parallel NetCDF calls.

Sampling identified source-curve recomputation inside every LM residual and
Jacobian as the next CPU hotspot. Like upstream `ydatv`/`ydatvks`, Rust now
precomputes invariant observations once per patch in flat pressure-major buffers.
Recorded residual vectors and full finite-difference Jacobian checks pass. A
512-cell, 200-evaluation microbenchmark has identical residual/Jacobian bit
hashes before/after; median times improve from 0.345 to 0.0196 s (VGM) and 0.0980
to 0.0106 s (Campbell). These are kernel timings, **not whole-case speedups**.
Artifacts: `/tmp/colm-fit-benchmark/`, `/tmp/colm-fit-probe/`. With the original
production `-fdefault-real-8` flag and explicitly r8 driver arguments, extracted
original callbacks agree on residuals to 2.3e-16 and Jacobians to 3.2e-14.
`comparison-production.json` supersedes the initial probe compiled without that
flag; compiler real-kind options are part of the reference contract.

The old scratch debug/release runs were deliberately stopped after each concrete
failure/profile diagnosis; their partial artifacts are retained, not counted as
successful full runs. The final `rust-full-precomputed/` run completed all eight
soil layers and vegetation in **248.68 s**, versus original **22 min 16 s** (about
5.4× observed wall-time ratio for this case, not a controlled cold-cache benchmark).
Rust initial completed in **4.46 s**. Both independently generated pipelines then
completed the **unchanged original `colm.x`** for two 1800-second steps, with all
surface/initial/runtime exit statuses zero. No job remains running at this checkpoint.

Full field and file inventory comparison found:

- 1,479 NetCDF filenames in each surface tree, none missing or extra;
- matching variable names, numeric types and dimension names in every paired file;
- 242 aggregated patch fields in each tree, none missing or extra, 32 bitwise equal,
  and no finite/nonfinite classification mismatches;
- one element (`132548`, eight patches) assigned to `e110_n20` in Rust instead of
  original `e105_n20`, changing 492 files' dimension lengths. Global memberships
  still match, but exact block ownership is **not yet reproduced**. Original votes
  via the source mesh grid during mesh_build, before later filtering; Rust currently
  recomputes from retained pixel midpoints. Attribute parity is not newly asserted.

Fitted soil fields remain a **scientific completion gate**, not harmless blanket
roundoff. Maximum observed surface differences include `k_s_l5 = 5.9904` and
`psi_s_l8 = 3.9350` in native units. The worst conductivity example is captured in
`fit-outlier.json`: element 207390, class 14, layer 5, 166 fine pixels / 44 unique
source cells. Rust's full run rejected the fit and retained `k_s = 14.4847`, while
Fortran accepted `8.49433`. Feeding the same captured source values and original
areas to the isolated Rust and production Fortran solvers reproduces the accepted
fit in both (difference about 1.3e-10). Thus the callback port alone does not explain
the production discrepancy; area/coordinate rounding and fit acceptance sensitivity
need resolution. Do not relax a tolerance to conceal that branch change.

`surface-comparison.json`, `schema-comparison.json` and `restart-comparison.json`
in the final run retain the complete measured differences. The independent
pipelines' post-two-step `gs0sun` difference reaches 19.6311 (native units); this
includes differing surface fits and is not an isolated initial-kernel error.
Previous runtime evidence above used the old common 7,698-patch surface instead.

The catchment writer now also emits `patchfrac_hru_<block>.nc` from parent-HRU
membership, covered area and optional `pctshared`. A targeted test checks
per-HRU normalization and serialization; both LCT and PFT/crop catchment commands
call it. This is not a real catchment all-field parity claim.

## Fresh regression evidence

- colm-init: 86 library tests + 12 binary tests; all 9 opt-in reference tests.
- colm-srfdata: 201 library tests + 30 binary tests; its opt-in reference test.
- Native executable test (now checking tuning overrides) and all 5 preprocessing
  integration tests passed, including common, PFT-BGC, PC-BGC, and urban runtime.
- `cargo clippy -p colm-init -p colm-srfdata --all-targets -- -D warnings` passed.
- Tuning tests verify all 15 overrides plus fixed `tcrit` on disk, defaults,
  invalid scalar types, nonfinite values, physical bounds, and potential order.
  A real tuned Pearl River initialization also passes strict `golden-compare`
  for all 16 scalar constants against Desktop Fortran (`tuned-comparison.log`).
- Dependent `colm-cli`, `colm-kernel`, and `colm-case` all-target checks passed.
  Workspace formatting remains blocked by pre-existing formatting differences
  in `colm-kernel/src/lib.rs` and `run.rs`; changed Rust files are checked separately.

## Remaining completion gates

1. Resolve the captured soil-fit acceptance and exact block-ownership differences.
   Both independent full LCT pipelines now run, but field parity is not established.
   Validate actual PC/PFT configurations and their scientific budgets separately.
2. Finish the remaining executable-control audit. The 15 `RestartTuning`
   namelist fields are now forwarded through single-point, spatial LCT/urban,
   PFT/PC, and explicit spatial PFT entry points. `tcrit` remains the upstream
   fixed 2.5. Other tuning/parameterization controls still need individual checks.
3. Trace the remaining surface controls (`DEF_Output_2mWMO`,
   `DEF_SOLO_PFT`, `DEF_FAST_PC`, `DEF_file_mesh_filter`) through topology and
   executable adapters. Identifier absence is a triage signal, not a completed
   behavioral audit. Verify their enabled and disabled branches. ZIP aggregation
   still needs PFT/PC-specific, crop, urban, and regular-coordinate adapter audits;
   catchment `patchfrac_hru` now has a targeted writer regression, not a real-case
   complete branch comparison.
4. Retain separate evidence for regular-grid, catchment, USGS, PFT/PC, crop,
   urban, BGC/methane, observations/continuations, LULCC, downscaling, and routing.
   Existing synthetic and single-point tests do not prove the complete matrix.
5. Replace the remaining macOS source-handle-retention workaround with bounded
   source I/O ownership/staging. Other platforms now close normally, but no
   Windows execution was performed here. Do not describe this as universal
   NetCDF/HDF5 mount safety.

## Exact geometry and source-block ownership follow-up

The completed `rust-full-geometry/` run supersedes the numerical/block results
of `rust-full-precomputed/` above; both are retained as independent artifacts.

- All four pixel-edge arrays now match the original **bit for bit**. The 992
  latitude / 2,496 longitude discrepancies were entirely explained by the
  production Fortran build's fused multiply-add grid generation. Rust records
  this single rounding explicitly, including the near-zero equatorial edge.
- Shared surface weights now retain `areaquad`'s rounded degree conversion,
  km² units and multiplication order. The absolute-area catchment consumer
  converts km² to m²; normalized-weight consumers need no conversion.
- Source-grid block votes are frozen before land-only compaction and reused by
  every writer. Clipped domain starts, both latitude orientations, unreferenced
  thin strips and mismatched subsequent block layouts have regressions. The
  former element 132548 mismatch is gone; all 957 element owners now agree.
- All 15,922,348 memberships / 7,754 patches still agree. Maximum element patch
  fraction difference is **3.86e-15**, down from 1.71e-12.
- All **1,479** file names, dimensions (including lengths/unlimited flags),
  variables, types and variable attributes agree. The only attribute inventory
  difference is upstream's per-file `create_time`, absent in Rust.
- There are still 242 patch fields, with no missing/extra fields or finite-mask
  mismatches. All non-soil-fit fields pass the recorded 1e-12 absolute/relative
  comparison. **48 fitted soil fields still exceed it**; this is not a parity pass.

Surface / initial / unchanged original two-step runtime all exit zero, taking
**193.17 / 2.43 / 6.54 seconds** respectively. Surface is about 22% less elapsed
time than the preceding 248.68 s run, but cache state and concurrent validation
were not controlled; this is an observation, not a benchmark guarantee.

The earlier 44-source-cell outlier now takes the same accepted VGM branch:
`k_s_l5 = 8.494329182793543` vs original `8.494329182669710`, rather than retaining
14.484728866078875. Remaining worst surface differences are `k_s_l1 = 4.14876`
and `psi_s_l8 = 2.50504`; after two model steps `gs0sun` differs by up to 3.65504.
The remaining nonlinear-solver/reference-rounding audit stays open. No fit
criteria or scientific acceptance tolerances were relaxed.

Validation: 205 surface library + 30 binary tests, 86 initial library + 12 binary
tests, five real raster and six real-site checks; the ten opt-in library Fortran
reference checks pass. Clippy (both crates/all targets, warnings denied),
downstream CLI/kernel checks and changed-file formatting pass. Native binary
and all five native pipeline checks pass when run with `--test-threads=1`.
A concurrent native-pipeline run exposed missing global-header failures for
PFT-BGC/urban; its cause is being tracked separately, not counted as a parallel
validation pass. Logs use `/tmp/colm-geometry-*`; case comparisons and binary
hashes are inside `rust-full-geometry/`.
